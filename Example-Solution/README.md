# StarterKit-Globhe-Python
RestClient with example solution for The Considition 2019 hackathon written in Python.

Requires FastAI (https://docs.fast.ai/install.html) and the package *requests* to work.
Use the example_solution.ipynb notebook as a starting point to build, train and export your model.
Then run main.py to start a new game. This will load your model and feed it with images from the API.
The final task of analyzing the model's output and calculating percentages for each image is left to you!
